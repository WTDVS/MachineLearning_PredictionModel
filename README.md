# MachineLearning_PredictionModel
Prediction Model Assignment for Machine Learning course

Analysis is based on a study ( http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har ) 
and a corresponding weight lifting  dataset where participants were asked 
to perform excercises in five different ways.  A set of 20 test cases with data
accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm and dumbell of the participants will 
be used to predict which one of the five different modes were employed while 
performing the exercise: 

   (A) exactly according to the specification 
   (B) throwing the elbows to the front
   (C) lifting the dumbbell only halfway
   (D) lowering the dumbbell only halfway 
   (E) throwing the hips to the front

Analysis Products:

1) R markdown and compiled HTML file describing analysis

2) Predictions based on 20 test cases using the model recorded as 20 separate files.
